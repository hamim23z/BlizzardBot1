This is a bot for my Discord reselling server called 'Blizzard Notify'. The purpose of this bot is to make member's lives more easier. As of right now, there are two modules: Website Checker and Shoe Size Checker/Converter. 

Website Converter: As a reseller, it is crucial to know what type of website the shoe or item you want is on because it will let you know if you are able to purchase or how to set it up. There are different types of websites. There are Footsites, Shopify sites, YeezySupply, and sites that run their own software. 

Size Checker/Converter: Members will be able to enter a shoe size, starting with mens sizes. And then a message will appear showing that pair converted into women's, gradeschool, Europe, and United Kingdom. 

There are other modules in development and they will be added here. **The token is hidden to ensure privacy of the bot**.
